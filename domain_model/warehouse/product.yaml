  gtin:
    description:  |
      A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products
      and services, using numeric identification codes. The gtin property generalizes the
      earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.
      The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs. A correct gtin value should
      be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12,
      13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component
      should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs.
      See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values
      is not required or encouraged.
